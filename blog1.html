      <p><br>I started this passion project as a way to help people while applying my newly learned knowledge of front end development. Before learning HTML and CSS, I only had a experience with writing small Python scripts to streamline data analysis at the lab that I work at. Since Python is fundamentaly very different from HTML and CSS, I would say that I basically started this endeavor as a beginner.
        It took me roughly two weeks of consistent studying and around ten hours of trying to code my own website for me to be able to code this entire website within a week.
        Below are the resources I used and how I used them:<br><br>

        After some brief research on reddit, I found a general consensus recommending <a href='https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/'>Interneting is Hard</a> as the go to resource in learning HTML and CSS. The course consists of 14 chapters where the reader can follow along the lesson and type their own code using their recommended text editor: <a href='https://atom.io/'>Atom</a>. Each chapter takes less than an hour to complete and provides you with a wealth of information. The course starts with basic HTML: the language used for the semantic components of your website. All the words, images, and icons that your website displays is mainly done so through HTML. After HTML, the course dives into CSS, the language used to format your website. While HTML may contain the content of your website, CSS is what you use to style it. All the coloring, sizing, and positioning of this website’s contents are done so using CSS. A good portion of the course focuses on using CSS to position your text where you want it as well as using it to make your website responsive to different screen sizes (a difficult task I chose to forgo with this website). As someone with a relatively short attention span, I finished this course by completing one chapter a day consistently for two weeks. Although Interneting is Hard made learning HTML and CSS easy, I found out that coding your own website is a whole other animal. <br><br>

        I started coding my own personal website right after finishing the HTML & CSS Is Hard course. Although I firmly believe that diving straight into a project is the best way to learn how to code, I ran into a lot of problems with my first site:<br><br></p>
        <ol>
          <li>As a STEM major with no background in design, I’m not ashamed to admit that the design of my website was absolutely unsightly.</li>
          <li>I found myself writing a lot of redundant code which ate away a lot of my time.</li>
          <li>I didn’t know how to actually publish it to the internet.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <p>As far as the first problem goes, my design skills are unfortunately still abysmal. For anyone wanting to make a polished product I definitely recommend finding a UX/UI designer to draw out your webpage for you. I was lucky enough to have <a href='https://www.instagram.com/yongqi.design/'>a friend</a> who does just that and she agreed to help me design this website. If you want to see how much of a difference it makes, please check out <a href='https://stefan-wei.github.io/'>my own website</a> sloppily designed by yours truly. For the second problem, the only thing I can recommend is that you make sure you have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. By knowing which tags can be reused, you’ll save yourself a lot of time typing the same thing ten times. Once you have a website that you’re proud of, you can publish it to the internet by hosting it for free using GitHub. Please refer to the video below for a tutorial on how to do that:</p> <br>

        <iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hAsDjEo9Oqw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p><br>After going through all of these steps you should have a nice website hosted on GitHub Pages. You can change your domain name to something custom by buying it from a domain registrar for a small annual fee.<br><br>
           Please note that this is far from the full potential of a working website. As you will notice with this website, it is purely static. There’s no fancy movement or collapsible windows because I haven’t taken the time to learn JavaScript yet.
           JS is in charge of adding interactivity to your website and I plan on learning it after I publish this site. Also, please note that this website is purely composed of front end development.
           There are no forms that deliver information to the back end which handles data manipulation. I chose to use a Google Form for collecting the necessary information I need purely out of convenience for my team.
           In the future I hope to learn more about back end development so that I can create a fully standalone website.</p>
