      <p><br>It is hard to believe that three months have passed since the stay-at-home orders were first put into place.
            Given the time that we have had to adjust to the new normal of working at home, the whole process should be engraved in my body by now.
            But everyday is a new struggle, my willpower crumbling away with every second of the day. As disorienting as it was taking classes and studying at home,
            summer brings with it a whole nother problem: the evaporation of routines. <br><br>

            Thinking back to my life on a college campus, my daily routines were set in stone. Every morning I would wake up at 7AM, make myself a cup of coffee and dig into a book.
            At around 9AM, I get ready to head out for classes. Once outside of my apartment, I do not return until about 6PM, using any time I have in-between, or after classes to study at the library.
            Once at home, I typically cook myself a quick meal before returning to the books to study before bed (the pre-med life is not a particularly liberating lifestyle).
            I have kept this routine since the beginning of my second year; it took me my whole freshman year of mistakes to find one that works best for me.
            This all went down the drain in March, when I came home because of the pandemic. <br><br>

            In my occupational therapy class at school, we had learned about the importance of habits and routines in our daily lives. They provide us with well worn-in grooves for us to go about our day,
            exerting less mental energy and allowing our bodies to go on autopilot. This prevents anxiety, irritation and stress in our everyday lives. As much as studying and attending class were the core of my routines,
            the act of walking to my classes, looking for a seat at the library, and reflecting on my day as I walk home had also become a fundamental part of my daily life, something I could not experience in quarantine.
            At first I thought, “I just need time to adjust to a new environment, with time everything will set into place again”. I thought that with enough repetition, I could teach my body to naturally enforce boundaries
            between work and home. Nothing set into place for the rest of my spring semester. <br><br>

            I was lazier than ever, not knowing when to wake up, when to start working, or even when to sleep. This is when I came across the article “The Routines That Keep Us Sane”, from the Atlantic.
            In the article, Currey explains that the key to forming new routines is not the timing of daily occupations, but rather, how they make us feel. Becoming fully absorbed in a task that is both engaging and satisfying
            gives us direction, leaving us wanting to do more. In occupational therapy, we call this state of mind the “flow state”. Proposed by Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow is an experience of immersion in a task that is
            composed of 9 key elements:<br><br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Challenge-Skills Balance:</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Flow requires a balance between challenge and ability level. If a task is too challenging, we get frustrated. If it is too easy, we get bored.</li>
          </ul></li><br>

          <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Action-Awareness Merging:</em>
            <ul>
              <li>When in the flow state, people become absorbed in their activity and focus of awareness is narrowed down to the activity itself.</li>
            </ul></li><br>

            <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Clear Goals:</em>
              <ul>
                <li>Goals are clear and explicit, the expectations and rules are discernable.</li>
              </ul></li><br>

              <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Unambiguous Feedback:</em>
                <ul>
                  <li>Successes and failures in the course of the activity are apparent, allowing us to adjust our behavior as needed.</li>
                </ul></li><br>

              <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Concentration on the Task at Hand:</em>
                  <ul>
                    <li>In the flow state, one is absorbed in the activity, only aware of what is relevant to the task at hand, and not thinking about unrelated things.</li>
                  </ul></li><br>

                  <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Sense of Control:</em>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A sense of personal control over the situation or activity.</li>
                    </ul></li><br>

                    <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Loss of Self-Consciousness:</em>
                      <ul>
                        <li>One becomes so absorbed in a task that they no longer feel insecure or self-conscious (no longer think about what others think of them).</li>
                      </ul></li><br>

                    <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Transformation of Time:</em>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A distorted sense of time occurs (either slowing down or speeding up).</li>
                        </ul></li><br>

                        <li style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:normal"><em>Autotelic Experience:</em>
                          <ul>
                            <li>The activity is intrinsically rewarding, so there is effortlessness in action.</li>
                          </ul></li><br>
                        </ol><br>

          By finding a project that gives us this sensation of utter absorption, new habits and routines will naturally follow.
          Currey suggests that these new routines may be better suited for our current situation than those that are imposed from work or school schedules.
          “We know full well that the insertion of new habits or the changing of old ones is the only way to preserve life, to renew our sense of time, to rejuvenate, intensify,
          and retard our experience of time—and thereby renew our sense of life itself.”<br><br>

          This is something to keep in mind the next time you feel unproductive and stuck in the destabilizing nature of our situation.
          Allowing for new habits to kick in takes time, but until then, just take a step back, pause, and take in the moment. Time spent reflecting on our everyday occupations is just as important a step as forming a new routine itself.
          And with that, I want to end with this quote from the article. <br><br></p>

          <div class='quote'><p>&ldquo;The world is very strange right now, and also quite frightening. It is natural to want to fall back on familiar routines or invent new ones in an effort to shield ourselves from so much uncertainty.
          But too much routine may prevent us from seeing this moment for what it is, and may short-circuit our ability to come up with creative solutions and new systems for living.
          Letting ourselves feel adrift now may allow us to take proper action later.&rdquo;</p><br><br></div>

          <p>I plan on using this summer as an opportunity. An opportunity to find myself, my interests, my values. I feel that everyday, I discover something new about myself, redefining my ideals and goals.
          Each new day brings with it a new version of myself, one that I like better. </p>
